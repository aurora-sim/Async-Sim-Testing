I wanted my grid to run locally on my internal network ip address. To do thisâ€¦

Using 10.0.1.5 as the example local IP, but you should change it to your own, if it's different.

Grid Mode:

Make sure it says HostName = 10.0.1.5 under [Network] section in the Aurora.Server.ini, Aurora.ServerBase.ini and Aurora.ini files.

Local Grid only: 

Make sure it says HostName = 10.0.1.5 under [Network] section in the Aurora.ini file.
