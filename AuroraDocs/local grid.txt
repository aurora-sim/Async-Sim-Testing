I wanted my grid to run locally on my internal network ip address. To do thisâ€¦

in Aurora.ini: 

make sure it says HostName = 10.0.1.5 under [Network] section

and then in Aurora.Server.ini

make sure it says HostName = 10.0.1.5 under [Network] section also

of course you want to change 10.0.1.5 to a local IP of your own.
